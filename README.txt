Assignment 1 for CMPT361 by RIley Bromley

I completed all the steps to the best of my ability in the program.
My testing resulted in only 1 bug that I wasn't able to resolve, regarding a game over state.

My game stops when shapes stack into the second from the top row. However there are cases
where there are still possible locations for a shape to spawn, but it doesnt. The function
for this feature is in board.cpp


The assignment document only talks about handling 3 identical fruits in a row horizontally, vertically or diagonally.
My game handles any horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line of 3 or more identical fruits.

I completed this entire assignment in a linux environment.
